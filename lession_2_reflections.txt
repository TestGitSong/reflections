Staging
Add files that you have changed to staging only when you are ready

Different from Working area


Branching
git branch		- list the branches and * shows the current branch
git branch name	- creates a new branch from where you are at
git checkout name	- attach to that new branch

git log --graph --oneline master coin

Branches and reachability
can a parent commit be reached through other parents

git checkout -b branch_name
is equivalent to 
git branch name	- creates a new branch from where you are at
git checkout name	- attach to that new branch

Diagrams show the structure of the branch tree and 
highlight leaf nodes that are inaccessible.

Merging
git merge will alway merge the branches 
listed into the currently connected branch

git merge master coins

If things go wrong, to revert
git merge --abort


git config --global user.name "Matthew North"
git config --global user.email "matthew.north@csc.com"
fix username and email of commitor

git commit --amend --reset-author
correct the user of the last committer


$ git merge master coins

branching and merging to concept map

Automatic merging vs manual merging
automatic good but can make mistakes in areas that are not local
manual good but prone to human error
